# Data Retrieval via NLP

## About
A search engine to look for certain files from the user.
Using machine learning and PyTorch to develop a model that can utilize NLP to search for and return relevant texts and images to the user's query.
Employs semantic embedding (for meaning rather than word frequency) and convolutional neural networks to retrieve data.

## Abstract
Modern devices allow users to search for certain files, but solely utilize the names of the files, instead of the contents stored within. As humanity progresses technologically, the increasing amounts of data will serve as a barrier to a practical application of the latter task in terms of time and cost. This will necessitate accurate methods for finding information in a timely and effective manner. In this work, we create a system to search for relevant content within texts and images in respect to a userâ€™s queries utilizing NLP that is both productive and accurate when tested on over 300,000 sources of data.

## Usage
Store a set of .PDF files and images or download these prepared .TXT files in a directory you can remember.
