# Data Retrieval via NLP

A search engine to look for certain files from the user.
Using machine learning and PyTorch to develop a model that can utilize NLP to search for and return relevant texts and images to the user's query.
Employs semantic embedding (for meaning rather than word frequency) and convolutional neural networks to retrieve data.
