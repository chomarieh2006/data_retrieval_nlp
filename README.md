# Data Retrieval via NLP

## About

A search engine to look for certain files from the user.
Using machine learning and PyTorch to develop a model that can utilize NLP to search for and return relevant texts and images to the user's query.
Employs semantic embedding (for meaning rather than word frequency) and convolutional neural networks to retrieve data.

## Usage

Requires a set of .txt files and images to run this program. 

To search for .txt files, run:

```
python3 doc_retrieval2.py
```

## Note

Program is not yet finished and is subject to change
